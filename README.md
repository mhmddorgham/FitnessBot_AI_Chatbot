### Introduction:
The use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in the health and fitness industry has gained considerable attention in recent years. AI-powered chatbots have been developed to assist individuals in achieving their fitness goals by providing personalized workout and diet plans(Yu, Beam & Kohane 2018). These chatbots use deep learning and natural language processing techniques to understand and respond to user queries, thereby providing a more personalized and effective fitness experience(Sqalli et al. 2021).
